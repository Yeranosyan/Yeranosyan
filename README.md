# üëã Hey there, I'm Gagik Yeranosyan

I'm Software Engineer focused on building high-quality business applications.  
Skilled in **JavaScript, Angular, React, Next.js, TypeScript, Node.js, Express**, and **ASP.NET Core Web API**.  
I‚Äôm a certified developer and also run a YouTube channel where I share tutorials and help developers grow their skills.

I always contribute by helping customers make the best possible decisions.  
Before building anything, I focus on understanding what problem I'm solving, what matters most to our users,  
and how I can deliver the best possible experience.

My goal is to improve every day ‚Äî by listening to customer needs, learning from feedback,
